### [Project 1: Exploratory](https:)

![](https://project-01-thumbnail.png)

It is required to have an official permit from the municipality that gives permission for filmmaking while balancing the needs of the community in the neighborhood. NYC is one of the most popular filming locations in the country, but as with everything else there has been a sharp decline in filming related activities due to COVID-19 in 2020. 
This project aims to explore both the history of trends of permits over <strong>years, seasons, regions and category </strong>and to document <strong>the impact of and future rebound from the pandemic</strong>.

* What are most common film making activities (e.g. Tv shows, movies)?
* Which parts of the city are most popular for film making?
* What are the seasonal trends (summer, Christmas)?
* What is the impact of COVID (early and late-COVID) and will it improveâ€¦?
