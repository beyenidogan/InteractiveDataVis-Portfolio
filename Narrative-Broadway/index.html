                            The first theaters in New York City was opened in 1750 on Nassau Street with capacity of 280 for performances of Shakespearian plays and operatic theater. 
                            Later, beginning around 1850 the heart of theater moved from downtown gradually to midtown Manhattan due less expensive real estate at the time.

                            Today <span style="color:#DC756D; font-weight: 900;">Broadway Theater </span> <a href="https://www.broadway.org/broadway-theatres" target="_new" title="As recognized by Broadway League">refers to</a> a collection of <span style="color:#DC756D; font-weight: 1000;">41 venues </span>with a seating capacity of <span style="color:#DC756D; font-weight: 900;">at least 500 people</span>, between West 40th and West 53rd Streets. Only four of them are actually on Broadway.
                            If a facility hosts concerts and dance shows more often than it does plays or musicals, it isn't considered a Broadway theater, regardless of the seating situation.

                            <br>
                            Those with <span style="color:#017a96; font-weight: 900;">100 to 499 seats</span> are regarded as <span style="color:#017a96; font-weight: 900;">"Off-Broadway"</span> venues regardless of the location. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Meanwhile, establishments with 99 seats or fewer are deemed <span style="color:#6d6d6d; font-weight: 900;">"Off-Off-Broadway"</span> which are more widely dispersed throughout the city.
